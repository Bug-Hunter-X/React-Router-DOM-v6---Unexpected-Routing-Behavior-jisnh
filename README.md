# React Router DOM v6 - Unexpected Routing Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router DOM v6: unexpected routing behavior.  Routes may not match correctly, leading to incorrect page renders or blank screens.

The problem often stems from incorrect path configurations or missing route components. This example showcases a simple scenario to illustrate the problem and a solution to address it.  Refer to the `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` files for code examples.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the routing behavior.  You should encounter issues where routes don't match as expected.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing path configurations and ensuring that the correct component is rendered for each route path.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates an example of how to correctly configure routes to resolve the issue.  In more complex scenarios, additional debugging techniques might be necessary.
